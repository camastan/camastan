Hi! I'm a passionate and curious learner on a journey to become a skilled Data Analyst. With a background in finance and a strong foundation in tools like Excel, Power BI, and VBA, I’ve always been fascinated by the power of data to uncover insights and drive smart decisions.

I'm currently expanding my skill set to include SQL, Python, and advanced data visualization techniques. I believe that data tells a story—and I'm here to learn how to read it, interpret it, and share it effectively.
